# First step: Get great content

The videos you record, buy online or find for free will play a big role in the final aesthetic of your video. So don't take this step lightly. We'll show you the best places to get great content depending on your budget.


## 1. Capture original videos

I'm sorry to tell you, but you might have to go outside. Think about the quality and degree of professionalism you need. Is your video important? You may have to hire a video professionnal.

Is it just a quick video? For many small projects, a recent smartphone is all you need, so get out and grab videos!

## 2. Use free and public domain videos

Did you know you can get videos and pictures for free? The best part is that some even allow commercial use. A great example is Pixabay.

You'll be surprised by the quantity and quality of stock footage on [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com). You could practically make entire videos with some text and editing and Pixabay videos. However, I strongly recommmend including relevant original videos to put more value into your video.

Warning: Always read the license to know what you can or can't do with free content. Even free providers have restrictions on what can be done with their content.


### Public domain



If you want even more sources, you really should have a look at this list:

[What Do Public Domain & Creative Commons Mean?](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=310751&p=2072820) - Scroll past explanations to find a long list of sources.

## 3. Find stock videos online


## 4. Repeat 2 and 3 for audio
