Unleash the power of the internet, find content and assemble videos!

# First step: Get great content

The videos you record or buy online (or find for free) will play a big role in the final aesthetic of your video. So don't take this step lightly. We'll show you the best places to get great content depending on your budget.


## 1. Capture original videos

I'm sorry to tell you, but you might have to go outside for this step. Think about the quality and degree of professionalism you need. Is your video important? You may have to hire a video professional.

<p class="img-legend">Know someone with that?</p>

Is it just a quick video? For many small projects, a recent smartphone is all you need, so get out and grab videos! It's not recommended, but you could try making a video entirely with stock footage bought online (see next steps!).

## 2. Use free and public domain videos

Did you know you can get videos and pictures for free? The best part is that some even allow commercial use. A great example is Pixabay.

You'll be surprised by the quantity and quality of stock footage on [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com). You could practically make entire videos from their content (Provided you add some text, images, music). I strongly recommend including original videos to put more value into your creation. If you put low effort and money in your video, in the end you'll get a low quality result. It's basic math. So consider paying.

Warning: Always read the license to know what you can or can't do with free content. Even free providers have restrictions on what can be done with their content.

Additionally, you can find free content on Focastock:

### Public domain

I could have posted a thousand links about public domain videos, but that job has already been done.

If you want even more sources, you really should have a look at this list:

[What Do Public Domain & Creative Commons Mean?](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=310751&p=2072820) - Scroll past explanations to find a long list of sources.

## 3. Pay stock videos online

Several sites sell stock video.

If you are willing to pay, you will find more content.

The major players in the stock video market are:

* [videohive.net](https://videohive.net/)


## 4. Repeat 2 and 3 for audio

Find a nice audio track for your site. Consider recording your voice. If your voice is shitty like mine, you can always try to find a narrator on fiverr:

<p class="img-legend" style="font-size:16px;">Narrators of fiverr will lend you their nice voice in exchange for some cash</p>

[Search fiverr for a narrator](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=narrator)

(You should go there just for the sake of listening to their deep soothing voices in the previews)

# Putting it together

There are many tools to bring videos together. The option I'd recommend is Lattefx, which I'm developing.
